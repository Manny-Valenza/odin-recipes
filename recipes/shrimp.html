    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Étouffée is a dish consisting of shellfish cooked in a rich sauce served over rice. The secret to authentic étouffée is a cooking technique called "smothering," a Cajun and Creole cooking technique that is similar to braising. In French, "étouffée" means "smothered." </p>
